## Introduction
The ability to generate value for businesses by leveraging data and applying pertinent programming abilities is the fundamental component of both Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The way individuals can now access and enjoy products and services from the comfort of their homes with just a few clicks has been transformed by industry leaders like Netflix, Amazon, and Uber Eats. These platforms have used recommendation algorithms to improve the user experience. Users are catered to by these systems, which provide an abundance of customized options that are carefully crafted to suit their individual interests and tastes. Within this framework, Python is a vital resource that provides an adaptable and strong environment for creating and implementing state-of-the-art recommendation systems.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3 installed on your system along with the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

3. Run the main Python script to execute the recommendation system:

```bash
python recommendation_system.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input user preferences and receive movie recommendations.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering: Recommends items based on the similarity between users.
- Content-based filtering: Recommends items based on the similarity between items and user profiles.
- Hybrid techniques: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.
- User-item matrix creation: Constructs a sparse matrix representation of user-item interactions.
- Movie similarity analysis: Identifies similar movies using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
- Movie recommendation: Suggests movies for a user based on their preferences and highest-rated movie.
